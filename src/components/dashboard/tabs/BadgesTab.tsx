      <>
        Blockscout Badges is a new initiative by the Blockscout Team, designed
        to celebrate and recognize our community members for their involvement
        in key campaigns and contributions.
      </>

  {
    question:
      "Are there different traits in each collection? What makes them unique?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Each Blockscout Badge collection features four distinct rarity levels,
        giving users an exciting opportunity to mint a legendary NFT. The rarity
        tiers include Common, Rare, Super Rare, and Legendary, with each mint
        offering a randomized chance at unlocking the most coveted level.
        Sometimes, you can also find <b>Epic badges</b> hidden within the
        Blockscout ecosystem.

  {
    question: "Why am ineligible?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Participants for each NFT were gathered during the designated campaign
        period. But don{apos}t worry â€” Blockscout will be launching more NFTs in
        future campaigns! Be sure to follow our social channels to stay updated
        on the next exciting opportunity.

    question: "Are collection items limited in quantity?",

    answer:
